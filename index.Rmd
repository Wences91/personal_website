## short bio

i am currently a postdoctoral researcher at ingenio (csic-upv) under a momentum contract. my academic background is rooted in scientometrics and data analysis, with a strong foundation developed during my predoctoral training in granada (spain). i have published extensively in leading scientometrics journals and regularly serve as a peer reviewer. in addition to my research activity, i have been actively involved in various national and international research and educational projects. in 2024, i held a postdoctoral position at arizona state university, further expanding my international research experience. in the same year, i was awarded a juan de la cierva contract, which i declined in order to accept the momentum fellowship. my professional profile also includes significant contributions to knowledge transfer as the chief operating officer of the [ec3metrics spin-off](https://yosigo.ugr.es). i have organized and taught courses both nationally and internationally, contributing to initiatives such as the european summer school for scientometrics and [#yosigougr](https://yosigo.ugr.es).
